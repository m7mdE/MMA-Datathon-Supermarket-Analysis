### Optimizing The 'Instabasket' Aisle: A Data-driven Approach
 
#### Main Objective

<p>To enhance the MM&A Experience by responding to a high demand from Instabasket personal shoppers by populating a specialized aisle, optimizing both product selection and substitution based on data-driven insights.

We used 2 methodologies:</p>

#### 1. Product Selection

<ol>
<li>Counted and sorted in descending order how many times an item were purchased
<li>Relabeled tagged ‘missing’ data for products Labelled products as ‘frozen’, ‘refrigerated’, or ‘other’ based on department
<li>Selected the top 100 products in 'frozen' and 'refrigerated' categories, then filled the remaining 800 spots with products from the 'other' category
<li>Calculated metrics</li>
</ol>

<p>Our team consist of 4. It was pleasure to work and collaborated</p>
